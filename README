Project for CS390Python @ Purdue.
=============================

I don't usually publish class projects, but this one I enjoyed a lot and was pretty happy with the end product.

I used bootstrap, python, apache and SQLite to build a social network of some assortment. It is a bit of a 
juxtaposition between facebook and google+ with the ability to build friend circles and privacy adjusted as such.

The link to the webpage is at:

new users automatically become my friend to show you a little bit of what the page looks like.
